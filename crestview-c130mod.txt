LAIRCM is an acronym for Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures, a missile defense system that protects large aircraft from heat-seeking missiles. It uses a laser to automatically detect, track, and jam incoming infrared (IR) threats, causing the missile to miss its target. The system consists of a processor, a control indicator unit, a missile warning system, and a laser transmitter assembly.

LAIRCM Modification consists of the following:

Missile Warning Sensors: These detect incoming infrared-guided missiles by scanning the surrounding airspace for heat signatures.

Laser Countermeasure Turrets: Once a threat is detected, these turrets emit laser energy to confuse or disable the missileâ€™s guidance system.

Control Electronics and Software: These coordinate the detection and countermeasure response, ensuring rapid and automated protection.

Aircraft Wiring and Structural Modifications: Includes installation of wiring harnesses, mounting brackets, and structural reinforcements to support the system.
